<h1>Mini-Project - SC1015</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This repository is for the mini-project in SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). The objective of this project is to predict the popularity of a song based on it attributes. It can be categorized into 5 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Preparation</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</li>
  <li>Model Training and Evaluation</li>
  <li>Predicting the popularity of a song based on user's input attributes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Are we able to create a model to predict a song's popularity based on music data?</li>
  <li>Are we able to ​assist composers and producers in creating popular songs by providing insights into the essential features?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Model Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-Variate Classification Tree</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The popularity of a song is not influenced by only a single variable. A mixture of attributes is required to influence its popularity rating.</li>
  <li>Rock, Pop and Hip hop genre songs are fairly distributed between the Not Popular and Popular categories.</li>
  <li>For the Country genre, where there is a skewed distribution with more songs falling into the Popular category, it suggests that certain characteristics or elements within Country songs resonate more strongly with audiences, leading to higher popularity ratings.</li>
  <li>Releasing many songs does not guarantee that your subsequent songs can be a hit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What did we learn from this project?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Overcoming the low correlation of a response and a single predictor by using multi-variate method.</li>
  <li>Analysing and visualizing of datasets to gain better insights</li>
  <li>Cleaning and preprocessing of datasets to gain accurate prediction of models</li>
  <li>Training models and predicting the outcomes to solve the problems</li>
  <li>Using Github to collaborate</li>
  <li>Being able to approach a song/music in a data scientist's perspective</li>
</ul>
